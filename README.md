- `bash`.
- `make`.
- `gcc`, 8 or higher.
- `nasm`.
- `objcopy`.
- `qemu` (to test it).
- `clang` (to test it).
- `llvm` (to test it).

## Building

```bash
# Clone repo wherever you like and enter.
git clone https://github.com/qword-os2/qword.git
cd qword
# Make the kernel, you can replace the 4 in -j4 with your number of cores + 1.
make clean && make -j4
# Install in PREFIX, may need root permissions depending on the place.
sudo make install PREFIX=..
# Uninstall if needed in the specified PREFIX.
